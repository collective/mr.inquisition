    <h1>mr.inquisition main page</h1>
    <p>
      The pages (browser views) offered by the mr.inquisition package are meant
      to give an insight in the contents of a Plone site. This can be helpful
      when e.g. migrating the site to another Plone version.
    </p>
    <p>
      The target audience is developers. Even though they may also
      like slick looking pages, the focus is on functionality, not
      esthetics.
